This is a lisp (more scheme really) interpreter written in Python. It is based on the interpreter written by Peter Norvig in this
article: https://norvig.com/lispy2.html. I have made some extensions to his original version and continue to update it based on the needs
of the projects that I am writing with this language.

The first of these projects is exploring [simulated annealing] (simulated_annealing/README.md).
